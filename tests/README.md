# Tests

This directory contains the test suite for the `egohub` library.

## philosophy

Our testing strategy follows the principles outlined in `testplan.md`. We use a combination of static analysis, unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the correctness and stability of the codebase.

- **Unit Tests**: These are fast, deterministic tests that check a single, isolated piece of functionality (e.g., a single function or class). They should not have external dependencies like network or disk I/O.
- **Integration Tests**: These tests verify that multiple components of the application work correctly together. For example, they might test the interaction between a `Dataset` and the HDF5 file it reads from. They are marked with `@pytest.mark.integration` and are not run by default with `make test`.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: These are the slowest and most comprehensive tests, checking a full user workflow (e.g., a CLI command). They are marked with `@pytest.mark.e2e`.

## How to Run Tests

The easiest way to run the core suite of fast unit tests is using the `Makefile` target:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment first
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run fast unit tests
make test
```

To run the full suite, including slower integration tests, you can use `pytest` directly:

```bash
# Run all tests except performance benchmarks
pytest -m "not perf" -n auto
```

To run only a specific type of test:

```bash
# Run only integration tests
pytest -m "integration"
```

## Key Files & Directories

- `tests/conftest.py`: This file contains shared fixtures that can be used by any test in the suite. Most importantly, it houses the `hdf5_file_factory` fixture, which programmatically generates valid, temporary HDF5 files for testing data pipelines.
- `tests/data/`: This directory contains small, static test assets. Currently, it holds a `sample.mp4` video file used for testing video processing. Binary files here should be small and are tracked with Git LFS if necessary.
- `tests/test_*.py`: Individual test files, where each file generally corresponds to a module in the `egohub` library.
- `tests/test_constants/`: This directory contains snapshot files generated by `pytest-regressions`. You should not edit these files manually; they are created and updated by running the test suite.

## Writing New Tests

When adding a new feature, please also add corresponding tests.
- For pure functions, add a unit test.
- For features that interact with data files or other modules, add an integration test and use the available fixtures.
- Remember to mark slow tests with `@pytest.mark.integration` or `@pytest.mark.e2e` so they don't slow down the default test run.
